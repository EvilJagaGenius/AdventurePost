m~Is there anything you wish to know?
q0~Who are you?
q1~Goodbye.
q2~
q3~
r0~I am Turaga Whenua, the ruler of this realm.  The Matoran here are miners and inventors, building machines to improve the lives of others throughout the island.|Because Onu-Wahi is not constrained to one portion of the island, but instead runs beneath all of it, top-dwelling Matoran come from everywhere to Onu-Koro.
r1~May Onua be with you, Huki.
