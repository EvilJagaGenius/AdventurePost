I peered through the door.  Sure enough, the huge double door into the hall was open, showing the forms of Damek and Nuparu.
    "Guys!"  I whispered.  Damek whirled around, Nuparu looked like he nearly had a heart attack.  I stifled a laugh.  "There's a guard in here.  Out cold."
    Damek was about to step in, but stopped.  "Hear that?" he whispered.  We waited, and then heard a mechanical clank.  Slowly and silently, he opened the door to the smaller passage.
    "We've got some company," he said, drawing his pistol.
