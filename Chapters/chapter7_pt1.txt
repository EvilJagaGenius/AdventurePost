Post 7, part 1:  No One was Supposed to Know


    We saw him at the same time.  My brain told me my eyes were working fine, my soul told me they weren't.
    Damek, cool as ever, leveled his airgun.  "Freeze."
    --Oh no.  Please, no.  Not... him?--
    "...Ahkmou?" Nuparu squeaked.
    At the mention of his name, he turned around.  I would have known him in an instant.  The pale orange of his perpetually scowling eyes, the flat black of his Rau.  Why?  Why was he here?
    And yet, some part of me expected to find him here all along.
    "Nuparu?"  Ahkmou started.  "What are you doing here, this isn't safe, it's dangerous, why..."  His eyes narrowed with hatred as he saw me.  "You."
    Damek strode forward.  "You are under arrest for unauthorized access to a military installation, assault on Ta-Koro Guard personnel, and sabotage.  Did I get anything wrong?"
    Ahkmou's eyes flashed for a split second.  His knee and both fists shot out simultaneously, clocking Damek in the groin, gut, and neck.  He looked at Nuparu.
    "I'm so sorry, my friend," he said, drew a silver canister out of his pack and popped off the lid.  As he darted up the stairs, lava spilled out of the can and melted most of the structure.
    "No!"  I shouted, running for the stairwell.  "Get back here!"
    "Huki, wait up!  Don't go alone!"  Damek called after me.
    "For Ahkmou?"  I replied.  "Oh no.  This punk is mine!"
