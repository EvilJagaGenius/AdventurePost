<<ITEMS>>
-Berry
    A simple Bula berry.  It restores 10% of your health.

<<HAZARDS>>
-Spike
    Rather sharp.  These will take off 25% of your health in one hit.  However, you can walk on the non-pointy edge--just make sure to jump off the spike to avoid cutting yourself on the point.

-Lava
    The Onu-Matoran call it 'hot sauce', but that doesn't mean it isn't dangerous.  The only way to cross it is by cooling it down or finding a Lava Surfboard.  For the brave, try luring an enemy into it.

<<ENEMIES>>
-Nui-Jaga, Purple
    All varieties of Nui-Jaga are known for their irritability and sharp stingers, but the purple breed is the only one known to hurl blobs of venom at its attacker.  The venom causes temporary blindness on contact.

-Nui-Rama, Green
    Nui-Rama come in two breeds: green and orange.  The green breed is the stronger of the two and has a penchant for sneaking up on its targets.  It can climb across walls, grab you and throw you down on spikes, or a very large pit.  Keep your distance.

-Nui-Rama, Orange
    The orange breed of Nui-Rama is much faster, and reckless, than its green cousin.  While not able to go through walls, it can perform berserker charges at incredible speeds.  Use this to your advantage and get it to crash into a wall.

-Kylae the Shadow Matoran
    No one really knows Kylae's past, other than that she was one of the first victims of the Shadow Plague.  Under Makuta's curse, she is forced to set off a bomb inside Onu-Koro's Great Mine.  Your job is to beat her to the bottom of the Mine and defuse the bomb.  She carries an Onu-Pneumatic Compact ChainGun and a sabre.  Avoid confrontation if possible.  If you find you can't beat her to the bottom, try diving.
