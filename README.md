Welcome to Adventure Posts.

# GAMEPLAY

## CHAPTERS
Use the UP or DOWN keys to scroll through the text, press ENTER when you've finished reading.

## LOCKS
Use the number keys to enter a combination.  Use BACKSPACE to erase part of your combination, press ENTER to test it.

## NPC's
Click on the red arrow to read more of what they're saying, click on one of the small boxes at the bottom of the screen to ask them a question.

## COMPANIONS
Click on the outline of a Matoran in the top-right corner to see what companions are traveling with you.  If you have more than one companion, click on the little arrows to the side of your companion's face to view the next one.  Click on the face to see what they have to say, click on the text box that shows up to read more.  When you're done, click their face again.

## SCENES
Move your mouse over the scene.  If it turns into a red arrow, click to move to a new scene.  If it turns into a grey circle, with an arrow inside it, click to turn around.  If it turns into a red speech bubble, it means there's a NPC you can talk to by clicking the bubble.  If there's a red hand on the screen, click to pick up an item.

## YOUR PACK
Click the pack icon in the top-right corner to open it up, click on an object to use it.  Not all objects work for all scenes, so think about where you should use them.

## PLATFORMER LEVELS
Use LEFT and RIGHT to move, tap UP to jump/double jump.  Press SHIFT to run, SHIFT and DOWN make you slide (useful for getting under some barriers).  SPACE lets you perform free-running moves on things; against a wall, you can bounce off of it.  SHIFT, SPACE, and an arrow key allow you to run across plaid wall-running blocks.

Hold DOWN and an arrow key while falling to break into a roll when you land, reducing your damage.  Dive down at an incredibly fast rate by jumping, then tapping DOWN twice.  (You'll take more damage on landing, though.)

### ITEMS
* Berry

A simple Bula berry.  It restores 10% of your health.

### HAZARDS
* Spike

Rather sharp.  These will take off 25% of your health in one hit.  However, you can walk on the non-pointy edge--just make sure to jump off the spike to avoid cutting yourself on the point.

* Lava

The Onu-Matoran call it 'hot sauce', but that doesn't mean it isn't dangerous.  The only way to cross it is by cooling it down or finding a Lava Surfboard.  For the brave, try luring an enemy into it.

### ENEMIES
* Nui-Jaga, Purple

All varieties of Nui-Jaga are known for their irritability and sharp stingers, but the purple breed is the only one known to hurl blobs of venom at its attacker.  The venom causes temporary blindness on contact.

* Nui-Rama, Green

Nui-Rama come in two breeds: green and orange.  The green breed is the stronger of the two and has a penchant for sneaking up on its targets.  It can climb across walls, grab you and throw you down on spikes, or a very large pit.  Keep your distance.

* Nui-Rama, Orange

The orange breed of Nui-Rama is much faster, and reckless, than its green cousin.  While not able to go through walls, it can perform berserker charges at incredible speeds.  Use this to your advantage and get it to crash into a wall.

* Kylae the Shadow Matoran

No one really knows Kylae's past, other than that she was one of the first victims of the Shadow Plague.  Under Makuta's curse, she is forced to set off a bomb inside Onu-Koro's Great Mine.  Your job is to beat her to the bottom of the Mine and defuse the bomb.  She carries an Onu-Pneumatic Compact ChainGun and a sabre.  Avoid confrontation if possible.  If you find you can't beat her to the bottom, try diving.
	
Start the game by running "PlayTheGame.bat".

To get information on the game while you're playing, try talking to the boat.  Yes.  The boat speaks.  It won't take you anywhere (yet) but it speaks.

That said:  Play well!
