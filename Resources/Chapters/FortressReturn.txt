    "Huki!  Thank heaven you're all right!"  Damek rushed to my side.  The Nui-Rama had dropped me into the snow, then vanished.  No buzzing, no flapping of the wings, suddenly it just wasn't there.
    I shivered half from dread, half from the bitter cold.
    "Nuparu was worried sick about you.  Wondered where the heck you could've been.  We looked out on the roof, but all of a sudden there were Rama all over the place."
    "What about Ahkmou?  Where was he?"
    "Gone.  Without a trace.  And the weird thing?  The pump was fine all along.  We go up there and it's just going like a kitten.  Nothing was done to it at all."
    "But... how?"
    "I sure as heck wish I knew."
    "The guards... are they okay?"
    "Oh yeah.  All came back about fifteen minutes ago.  Let's go in, anyway.  I needed to be alone but this cold is driving me nuts."
