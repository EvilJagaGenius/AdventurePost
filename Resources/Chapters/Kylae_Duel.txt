    --There it is.  The floor of the Mine.--
    Even though I had broken my fall, I was still going tremendously fast.  I grabbed a pipe on the wall and slid down, like I imagined a Guard would do.  My knees folded as I hit the floor, rolled.
    I turned around just in time to see the lift crash to the ground.  Bracing for an explosion, I ducked behind a crate.
    --No one could have survived that.--
    Mining tool in hand, I cut the lift's door right off the hinges.  Thank the Spirit the bomb hadn't gone off yet.  The CCG was nearby, its three barrels mangled together by the force of the fall.  I was studying the bomb when a glimmer of motion caught my eye.
    Suddenly, my mask was filled with black as the Shadow Matoran gripped me in a strangle hold.  Its yellow eyes were filled with hatred.
    --No, no, no...-- "You were supposed to be dead!"
    "So were you," it snapped back.  "You... are not.. supposed.. to be here!"
    Right as my vision started to fail, a memory shot through my head.  Me, staring at a gigantic boulder.  Bringing my head down on it, unafraid, then looking away to see broken stone and my unscathed mask.
    That same feeling drove my head forward, ramming the Shadow Matoran's wrists.  It let go long enough for me to duck and roll away.
    The tool, the mining tool... where was it?  It was outside the lift's cabin.  I grabbed it then turned around, hoping the Shadow Matoran wasn't on my heels.  It wasn't, it just stood in the doorway, drew a long, wicked black sword.
    "Makuta, grant me power!" it shouted, jumped high enough to flip three times, eyes blazing like lightstones.
