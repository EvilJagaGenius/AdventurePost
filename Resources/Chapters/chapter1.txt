Post 1:  Signs of Life

    --Where am I...?--
    I feel... something.  I don't want to open my eyes.  I don't want to stand up.  I just want answers.  I want to feel the warmth, the red glow of the sun behind my closed eyelids.  I want to know my name.
    This darkness feels so nice...
    My alarm overcomes my weakness.  Somehow, as if on some ancient stone tablet chiseled with the word Truth, I know I can't fall asleep again.  Yet I can't help it... it feels like something outside of me is pushing me to the edge of oblivion, a dark, unholy presence touching my mind.  I recoil at the thought, but it seems to know; as I try to comprehend it it fades away, leaving only a ghostly imprint on my memory.
    I can't follow that feeling.  I can't fall asleep.
    Suddenly it returns in full force, as if it was a hand stretching out to grab my frightened self, to shove me into a vast nothingness, a void.
    A voice says something, far away, miles away, across what seems like worlds comes a solid tone, one I can grasp and hold on to for my life.
    "D'yah, Cap.  Still stone cold.  Okay, bad pun.  I'll let you know if he does anything.  Out."
    For the first time I realize what the ground below me is.  Hard, dense, uncomfortable, with something pressing into my shoulder.  Rolling gently, but uncontrollably.
    --How could I ever sleep here?--
    Water.  I feel water.  A boat, a boat... I vaguely remember a boat.
    I need to know more.  I have to know more.  I have no choice.
    I open my eyes.
