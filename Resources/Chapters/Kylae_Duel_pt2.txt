    

    I hung back, not wanting the Shadow Matoran to notice me.  It seemed dazed, confused by my escape.
    A pity it didn't last.
    It dashed towards me, silent as death, the blade curving in a graceful arc at my legs.  I jumped over the sword, then kicked at the Matoran's head.  I skimmed its mask, but it avoided most of the impact.  It swung again, this time a cleaving blow from above.  I sidestepped, punched it in the gut.  But instead of doubling over, like I had expected, it simply took a step back and stabbed.
    My yell filled the mine as I fell to my stomach and let the blade pass over me.  I rolled up to see the Shadow Matoran about to finish me off, by impaling me to the dirt.  It had also let most of its body wide open to attack.
    I kicked again, a savage uppercut that landed solidly on the Matoran's mask.  As she fell to the floor, I got up and grabbed the mining tool.  The Matoran was already back up, reversing the grip on its blade.  My window of opportunity was closing, and fast.
    I didn't think.  Just charged.  The tool seemed to be orbiting around me of its own will, forcing the Shadow Matoran to back away and dodge.  Finally our weapons connected, I felt the sword vibrating with the impact.  The Matoran slashed at my left side, I stepped away.  As it jumped, preparing to spiral around, I saw it.
    The side of its mask was completely undefended.  And it could do nothing to stop its motion.
    The tool let out a clang as the hammer edge connected with the mask, knocking it askew and the Matoran out.
    I rushed to the bomb, saw the letters CCG scratched on its surface.
    --CCG?  But the thing is useless now...--
    The interface was locked with a combination code, three digits long.  Apparently there was a failsafe built in to the device.  If I could only unlock the code, defusing the bomb would be simple.  But there was no time to examine the damaged gun in the corner.
    --CCG... three digits...--
