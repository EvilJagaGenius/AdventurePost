Nuparu77.  The taWahi- scenes and Nuparu's lab are from his game, MNOLG: The Bohrok Swarms.  Find it at: http://www.bzpower.com/board/topic/8946-mnolg-the-bohrok-swarms/

Turakii #1 Lavasurfer, writer of the "Tentacles" story.  Kailani mentions it as an "incident" back in Ga-Wahi.  Read it here:

Al Sweigart.  His Pyganim module is used in the platformer for this game.  I also highly recommend his Invent with Python books.

The fortress- scenes were created with Quake 2, QOOLE, and the Dawn of Darkness mod.

The BioMedia Project.  Without it, no one would know this game existed.

And thanks to my sister, for teaching me Python.


To the glory of God
