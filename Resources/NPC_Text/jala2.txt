o~Strange... so it is true... the Shadow Matoran are leading the Rahi.  And the Makuta is most likely not killing my men, as I first believed, but using this Shadow Plague to enslave them.|It is horrible, but there is hope:  if they are mearly infected, as with any common Rahi, it may still be possible to save them.|Take this ring as proof I acknowledge this warning and give Captain Piatara my thanks.  Go to Onepu and show this ring to him.  He will give you a similar ring to take to your Captain.|
