o~Hail, adventurer!
m~I trust your travels are going well.
q0~How do you know me?
r0~How do I... Huki, how could anyone not know you?  You're the Koli champion, Po-Wahi's hero!|I should hope I know you... ask anyone in town, they will tell you the same.|But my apologies, I heard from Whenua you fell slightly ill in Onu-Koro.  That may have disturbed your memory.
q1~My travels?
r1~Why, yes, you just went on a journey to Onu-Wahi as they were setting up a Koli field.  You played a game against the Onu-Wahi team--well played, by the way.  Hafu was raving about it all last week.|From Onu-Wahi, you ventured to Ta-Koro, and later Ga-Wahi.  Pekka said you were asleep on the boat back to Po-Wahi.
q2~Who are you?
r2~I am Onewa, Turaga of the village of Po-Koro.  The Matoran here are master carvers, and their work is the envy of Mata Nui.
q3~Goodbye.
r3~I wish you the speed of Pohatu, adventurer.
bye~r3
