Welcome to Adventure Posts.

<<GAMEPLAY>>


  --CHAPTERS
    Use the UP or DOWN keys to scroll through the text, press ENTER when you've finished reading.

  --LOCKS
    Use the number keys to enter a combination.  Use BACKSPACE to erase part of your combination, press ENTER to test it.

  --NPC's
    Click on the red arrow to read more of what they're saying, click on one of the small boxes at the bottom of the screen to ask them a question.

  --SCENES
    Move your mouse over the scene.  If it turns into a red arrow, click to move to a new scene.  If it turns into a grey circle, with an arrow inside it, click to turn around.  If it turns into a red speech bubble, it means there's a NPC you can talk to by clicking the bubble.  If there's a red hand on the screen, click to pick up an item.

  --YOUR PACK
    Click the pack icon in the top-right corner to open it up, click on an object to use it.  Not all objects work for all scenes, so think about where you should use them.

  --PLATFORMER LEVELS
    Use LEFT and RIGHT to move, tap UP to jump/double jump.  Press SHIFT to run, SHIFT and DOWN make you slide (useful for getting under some barriers).  SPACE lets you perform free-running moves on things; against a wall, you can bounce off of it.  SHIFT, SPACE, and an arrow key allow you to run across plaid wall-running blocks.
    Hold DOWN and an arrow key while falling to break into a roll when you land, reducing your damage.  Dive down at an incredibly fast rate by jumping, then tapping DOWN twice.  (You'll take more damage on landing, though.)



Start the game by running "PlayTheGame.bat".



To get information on the game while you're playing, try talking to the boat.  Yes.  The boat speaks.  It won't take you anywhere (yet) but it speaks.



That said:  Play well!
